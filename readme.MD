# Maji Ndogo 
The objective is to automate the the data cleaning process in the pipeline. To achieve this, we need to create a module to interact with the Maji Ndogo database, a module to transform and clean the field-related data, and another module to process the weather data.


# Modules
    a. `data_ingesation.py` - All SQL-related functions, and web-based data retrieval.

    b. `field_data_processor.py` - All transformations, cleanup, and merging functionality.

    c. `weather_data_processor.py` - All transformations and cleanup of the weather station data.
